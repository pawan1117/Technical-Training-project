### Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Java using Swing. The game consists of a snake that moves around a board eating food and growing longer. The objective is to avoid colliding with the borders of the board or with the snake's own body.

#### How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake: up, down, left, and right.
- The snake will move continuously in the direction specified until it changes direction or the game ends.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the borders of the board or with its own body.
- The score is displayed on the screen, showing the length of the snake's body.

#### Files
- `SnakeGame.java`: Contains the main logic for the game, including the snake movement, collision detection, and drawing on the screen.
- `App.java`: Sets up the JFrame and initializes the SnakeGame panel.

#### Dependencies
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Swing library

#### How to Run
1. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
2. Run the `App` class, which will start the game window.

#### Controls
- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:
  - Up: Move the snake upwards
  - Down: Move the snake downwards
  - Left: Move the snake leftwards
  - Right: Move the snake rightwards

Enjoy playing the Snake Game!
